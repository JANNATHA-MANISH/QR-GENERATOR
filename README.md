# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Here’s a basic `README.md` file that you can use for your QR Code Generator project:

```markdown
# QR Code Generator

This is a simple **QR Code Generator** built using **React**. The app allows users to input a string, customize the size and background color of the QR code, and download the generated QR code image.

## Features
- **Generate QR Code**: Input any text, and generate a QR code.
- **Customize QR Code**: Change the background color of the QR code.
- **Adjust Dimensions**: Resize the QR code with a slider.
- **Download QR Code**: Once generated, you can download the QR code as an image.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js): [npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/qrcode-gen.git
   cd qrcode-gen
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app locally using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser. The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1. Enter any text into the input box.
2. Click on the **Generate** button to create the QR code.
3. Use the color picker to choose the background color of the QR code.
4. Use the slider to adjust the dimensions of the QR code.
5. Click the **Download** button to save the QR code as an image to your computer.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **QR Code API**: Uses `http://api.qrserver.com/v1/create-qr-code/` to generate QR codes based on user input.
